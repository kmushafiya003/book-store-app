 Project is building a really cool website for a bookstore. Using special tools  React.js and Tailwind CSS to make it look awesome and work smoothly.

Key features of  project include:

Pretty Design: The website will look really nice and be easy to use. People will enjoy browsing through the books because it will look so good.

Ordering Books Popup: We're adding a special window that pops up when someone wants to buy a book. It makes it easy for them to buy without leaving the page they're on.

Different Book Sections: We're organizing the books into different groups, like "Best Sellers" and "Top Picks". This makes it easy for people to find the kind of books they like.

Customer Reviews: There's a special section where people can read what others have said about the books they've bought. It makes the website even more interesting and trustworthy.

Dark Mode Functionality: Website isn't just visually appealing during the day; it's also easy on the eyes at night! With the Dark Mode feature, users can switch to a darker color scheme that's gentler on their eyes in low-light environments. This enhances accessibility and makes the website more comfortable to use, regardless of the time of day.
